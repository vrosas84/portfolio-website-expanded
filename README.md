# portfolio-website-expanded
Expansion on personal website that was originally just a single page. Added blog and photography pages
Will be updating using this as a backup of the website code and files.
Planning on eventually migrating away from raw html/css/js coding and move to a cms to simply blog posting but haven't found a theme I like
