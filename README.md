# portfolio-website-expanded
Expansion on personal website that was originally just a single page. Added blog and photography pages. 
Will be updating using this as a backup of the website code and files. 
Planning on eventually migrating away from raw html/css/js coding and move to a cms to simply blog posting but haven't found a theme I like. 
As as with the other version, anyone is welcome to clone this, but please provide your own content (resume, photos, projects, etc) and don't pass my content as your own.
