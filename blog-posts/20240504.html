                <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                    <p>Well this is awkward. I was doing so well getting this thing up and running and then life happened. It's been a busy year since my last post nearly a year ago. Changes at work, changes at home, new adventures. So much to inform you of.</p>
                    <p>First of all, a couple months after my last post, I bought a home. A nice little single-wide. Was hoping for a traditional home to avoid the lot rent but everything else in my price range ended up being too small. If they'd been that size at 2 bedrooms then that's fine but I was looking at 3 bedrooms.</p>
                    <p>Why was I looking at 3 bedrooms places you may be wondering since I live by myself? Well that's because my neice and her bf were gonna be living with me for a while so she could finish school. Why did my niece need to live with me? Cuz My sister's family moved to Pennsylvania</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">All by myself...</h2>
                    <p>My sister's husband got a promotion and had to move to PA. He moved right after my last post, with the rest of the family to follow the next summer. Then winter came...Idaho winters are not mild at all. Days if not weeks below freezing.</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><i>“If you make friends with yourself you will never be alone.”</i></blockquote>
                    <p>With that in mind, my sister and youngest niece decided to leave sooner but my oldest niece didn't want to. So since I was looking at new places to live anyway, they asked if she could stay with me and finish school and her nursing program.</p>
                    <p>Of course. I'd be happy to. They'd even pay rent and help out. Win-Win for everyone. Yeah that didn't last long. Like mother, like daughter...she moved out and got a place with her bf barely days after she turned 18. So here I am, alone, in this 3 bedroom place, just me and the cats again.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">I gotta stop doing this so late...</h2>
                    <p>And that's not even getting into work stuff. Plenty of changes there but not sure what I'm actually allowed to discuss (or how much I want to make public even). That's a story for another day I think.</p>
                    <p>Back to the housing thing, I guess I have some choices to make. Considering renting this place out. I can't do roommates. Family, sure. Girlfriend, sure. Stranger? No thank you. I need to see if the park has a preferred/recommended rental agency and see what the requirements are.</p>
                    <p>If I'm lucky, I can rent this place out for a decent amount, cover the entire mortgage and lot rent, and move back into a smaller place so I can go back to saving more money and paying off debt. This year was going to be the year I build up my savings and pay off a bunch of stuff...guess not</p>
                    <p>I mean I'm still saving and paying stuff off, just gotta be more mindful of my spending and gonna take longer to pay stuff off unfortunately. Anyways, that's enough for tonight I think. Oh I added a bunch of <a class="link" href="../photography.html">pictures</a> from my trip to mexico. They're here and on Instagram. I'll get into that next time.</p>
