                <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                    <p>So this is something new I'm going to be trying. I haven't decided on a theme for this other than being a personal blog and posting my thoughts. I won't be so informal as a journal, but will mostly be my thoughts on major events.</p>
                    <p>I'll be posting my learning experience as well. I'm working on learning HTML and CSS again. I used to know it quite well, but I stopped using it and stopped working on my coding skills. I want to get back into it.</p>
                    <p>I know I have a long way to go to catch up with current web technologies. I'll be using this blog to also chronicle my journey. I'll be posting things I learned, resources discovered, thoughts on new technologies and developments, etc.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">My Journey...Resumes?</h2>
                    <p>Other than re-learning HTML and CSS, I am also attempting to learn python. Not just for progamming, but also using it for web development. On top of that, I'd like to explore the different frameworks being used.</p>
                    <p>After reading my main page, all this focus on web development might seem on add passion. My degree is in Information Technology, not Computer Science. I studied cybersecurity. I've worked in surveillance and IP video for the past 6+ years.</p>
                    <p>All that being said, like the title of this post, I have always enjoyed learning. I think it has also slightly paralyzed me. I tend to jump from topic to topic when it comes to self-paced learning so I have a hard time finishing courses.</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><i>“You can teach a student a lesson for a day; but if you can teach him to learn by creating curiosity, he will continue the learning process as long as he lives.”</i></blockquote>
                    <p>This "endless curiosity" I appear to have developed has had its benefits as well. It is due to this that I've learned so much on so many topics, which has earned me so much respect at work.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">New Experiences</h2>
                    <p>Being such an avid learner has also opened many doors for me and provided me with many experiences I never thought possible. My thirst for knowledge has allowed me to excel in my position at work.</p>
                    <p>My previous jobs never felt very intellectually stimulating and didn't feel worth the stress. My current employer not only encouraged my learning, but rewarded me for it with pay, promotions, bonuses, and even simple praise.</p>
                    <p>I think that is something many bosses don't seem to realize. A simple "good job" goes a long way. While I'm not technically in a leadership position, I help train the new associates in my department and I always try to remember to offer them praise and encouragement.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Onward and Upward</h2>
                    <p>This first post has become much longer than I intended. Not sure entirely how to end it since I'm fairly new to this blogging thing. I'm not entirely sure how often I'll be making these posts, but I will make a conscious effort to post often.</p>
                    <p>P.S. I need to stop doing stuff like this in the middle of the night...</p>
